<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>The KAISER has conferred upon the Turkish GRAND VIZIER the Order of
  the Black Eagle. The GRAND VIZIER has had persistent bad luck.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"A few weeks ago," says Mr. ROBERT BLATCHFORD, I asked, "What manner
  of man is the Tsar? And now he has abdicated." We understand that the
  EX-TSAR absolves Mr. BLATCHFORD from all blame.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Amsterdam rumour to the effect that eighty thousand German
  soldiers had surrendered was followed the next day by the report that it
  was really ninety thousand. It appears that a recount was demanded.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Evening News,</i> ever ready to assist with economical hints,
  now throws out suggestions for renovating last year's suit. No mention is
  made, however, of the fact that people with fur coats can now obtain
  quite cheap butterfly-nets for the moth-chasing season.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In the Reichstag a member of the Socialist Minority Party has
  denounced the KAISER as the originator of the War. The denunciation made
  little impression on the House, as it was generally felt that he must
  have been listening to some idle street-corner gossip.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A cat's-meat-man informed the Southwark Tribunal at a recent sitting
  that he served over four hundred families a day. The unwisdom of
  permitting cats to have families in war-time has been made the subject of
  adverse comment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"I swear by Almighty God that I will speak the truth, no nonsense, and
  won't be foolish," was the form of oath taken by a witness at a recent
  case in the Bloomsbury County Court. It was explained to him that this
  was only suitable for persons taking office under the Crown.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It was urged on behalf of a man at the Harrow Tribunal that there
  would be no boots in the Army to fit him. If a small enough pair can be
  found for him it is understood that he will join the police.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We fear an injustice has been done to the large number of Mexicans who
  have lately entered the United States. It was at first suggested that
  they were of pro-German sympathies, but it now appears that they were
  only fugitives who had fled from the elections in Mexico.</p>

<hr class="short" />

    GROCER NEEDS A 'EART AS COLD AS AN 'INDENBURG."</p>
  </div>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>A man at Bristol charged as an absentee said that he had been so busy
  wilting poetry that he had forgotten all about military matters. His very
  emphatic assurance that he will now push on with the War has afforded the
  liveliest satisfaction to the authorities concerned.</p>


<div class="notice">
<p class="center"><b>NOTICE.</b></p>

  <p>The Proprietors of <i>Punch</i> are glad to announce that they find
  themselves in a position to revert, for the time being at any rate, to
  the type and size of <i>Punch</i> as they were before the recent
  changes.</p>
</div>

  <p>"Owing to restrictions on the output of beer," says a contemporary,
  "the passing of the village inn is merely a question of time." Even
  before the War it often took hours and hours.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is announced that a wealthy American lady with Socialistic leanings
  will, at the end of the War, marry a well-known conscientious objector at
  present undergoing a term of imprisonment. The American craze for
  curio-hunting has not abated one bit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A woman in North London who two years ago offered her services to the
  Government in any capacity has just been informed that her offer is
  noted. There is good reason to believe that she will he among the first
  women called upon for service in our next war.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Because a man had jilted her fifteen years ago, a Spanish woman shot
  him while he was being married to another woman. It is a remarkable
  thing, but rarely does a marriage ceremony go off in Spain without some
  little hitch or other.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Proper mastication of food is necessary in these times, and we are not
  surprised to hear that one large dental firm are advertising double sets
  of teeth with a two-speed gear attachment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to <i>The Pall Mall Gazette,</i> Mr. LLOYD GEORGE'S double
  was seen at Cardiff the other day. The suggestion that there are two
  Lloyd Georges in the world has caused consternation among the German
  Headquarters Staff.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The bones of a woolly rhinoceros have been dug up twenty-three feet
  below the surface at High Wycombe, and very strong expressions have been
  used in the locality concerning this gross example of food-hoarding.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Complaint has been made by a brass finisher at Oldham that his
  fellow-workmen will not speak to him because he receives less wages than
  they do. To end an awkward situation it is hoped that the good fellow may
  eventually consent to accept a weekly wage on the higher scale.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Punch's Roll of Honour.</h2>

  <p>WE record with deep regret the death from pneumonia of Captain HARRY
  NEVILLE GITTINS, R.G.A., on Active Service. He was a member of the
  Territorials before the outbreak of war, and, after serving two years at
  home, went out to France in August of last year. His light-hearted
  contributions to <i>Punch</i> will be greatly missed.</p>

<h2>THE MUD LARKS.</h2>

  <p>THE French are a great people; the more I see of them the more I
  admire them, and I have been seeing a lot of them lately.</p>

  <p>I seem to have spent the last week eating six-course dinners in
  cellars with grizzled sky-blue colonels, endeavouring to reply to their
  charming compliments in a mixture of Gaelic and CORNELIUS NEPOS. I myself
  had no intention of babbling these jargons; it is the fault of my tongue,
  which takes charge on these occasions, and seems to be under the
  impression that, when it is talking to a foreigner, any foreign language
  will do.</p>

  <p>Atkins, I notice, also suffers from a form of the same delusion. When
  talking to a Frenchman, he employs a mangled cross between West Coast and
  China pidgin, and by placing a long E at the end of every word imagines
  he is making himself completely clear to the suffering Gaul. And the
  suffering Gaul listens to it all with incredible patience and courtesy,
  and, what is more, somehow or other disentangles a meaning, thereby
  proving himself the most intelligent creature on earth.</p>

  <p>We have always prided ourselves that the teaching of modern languages
  in our island seminaries is unique; but such is not the case. Here and
  there in France, apparently, they teach English on the same lines. I
  discovered this, the other day, when we called on a French battery to
  have the local tactical situation explained to us. I was pushed forward
  as the star linguist of our party; the French produced a smiling Captain
  as theirs. The non-combatants of both sides then sat back and waited for
  their champions to begin. I felt a trifle nervous myself, and the
  Frenchman didn't seem too happy. We filled in a few minutes bowing,
  saluting, kissing and shaking hands, and then let Babel loose, I in my
  fourth-form French, and he, to my amazement, in equally elementary
  English. The affair looked hopeless from the start; if either of us would
  have consented to talk in his own language, the other might have
  understood him, but neither of us could, before that audience, with our
  reputations at stake.</p>

  <p>Towards lunch-time things grew really desperate; we had got as far as
  "the pen of my female cousin," but the local tactical situation remained
  as foggy as ever, our backers were showing signs of impatience, and we
  were both lathering freely. Then by some happy chance we discovered we
  had both been in Africa, fell crowing into each other's arms, and the
  local tactical situation was cleared "one time" in flowing Swahili. Our
  respective reputations as linguists are now beyond doubt.</p>

  <p>We became fast friends, this Captain and I. He bore me off to his
  cellar, stood me the usual six-course feed (with wines), and after it was
  over asked how I would like to while away the afternoon. I left it in his
  hands. "Eh bien, let us play on the Bosch a little," he suggested. It
  sounded as pleasant a light after-dinner amusement as any, so I bowed and
  we sallied forth.</p>

  <p>He led me to his observation post, spoke down a telephone, and about
  twenty yards of Hun parapet were not. "That will spoil his siesta," said
  my Captain. "By the way, his Headquarters is behind that ruined
  farm,"</p>

  <p>"Which?" I inquired; there were several farms about, none of them in
  any great state of repair.</p>

  <p>"I will show you&mdash;watch," he replied, talked into the 'phone
  again, and far away a cloud, a cloud of brick dust, smoked aloft.
  "<i>Voilà!</i>"</p>

  <p>He thereupon pointed out all the objects of local interest in the same
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"We will now give him fifty rounds for luck, and then we will return
  to my cellar for a cup of coffee," said he, and a further twenty yards of
  Hun parapet were removed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there came an answering salvo from Hunland, and a flock of
  shells whizzed over our heads.</p>

  <p>"Tiens!" my Captain exclaimed. "He has lost his little temper, has he?
  Naughty, naughty! I must give him a slap. A hundred rounds!" he shouted
  into the 'phone, and the German lines spouted like a school of whales
  blowing.</p>

  <p>Again the Bosch slammed across a heavy reply. My Captain leapt to his
  'phone. "He would answer me back, would he? The impudence! Give him a
  <i>thousand</i> rounds, my children!"</p>

  <p>Then for the next hour or so the sky was filled with a screaming
  tornado of shells, rushing, bumping, and bursting, and the Bosch lines
  sagged, bulged, quivered, slopped over, and were spattered against the
  blue in small smithereens.</p>

  <p>"And now let us see what he says to that," said my Captain pleasantly.
  We waited, we watched, we listened; but there came no reply (possibly
  because there was no one left to make one), and my Captain turned to me,
  shoulders shrugged, palms outspread, a grimace of apologetic disgust on
  his mobile face&mdash;like a circus-master explaining that his clown has
  got the measles: "Nottin, see you? <i>Pas d'esprit, l'animal!</i>"</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>

  <p>Certainly Hans the Hun does not seem to be enjoying the same high
  spirits he did of yore. Possibly he is beginning to regret the day he
  left the old beer garden, his ample Gretchen, and the fatty foods his
  figure demands. The story of Patrick and Goldilocks would tend to prove
  as much.</p>

  <p>The other day Patrick was engaged in one of those little "gains" which
  straighten out the unsightly kinks in the "line" and give the
  War-correspondents a chance to get their names in print.</p>

  <p>Patrick and his friends attacked in a snowstorm, dropped into a German
  post, gave the occupants every assistance in evacuating, and prepared to
  make themselves at home. While they were clearing up the mess, they found
  they had taken a prisoner, a blond Bavarian hero who had found it
  impossible to leave with his friends on account of half-a-ton of sandbags
  on his chest. They excavated him, told him if he was a good boy they'd
  give him a ticket to Donington Hall at nightfall, christened him
  Goldilocks for the time being, and threw him some rations, among which
  was a tin of butter.</p>

  <p>He listened to all they had to say in a dazed sulky fashion, but at
  the sight of the tin of butter he gurgled drunkenly and seemed to go
  light-headed. He spent a perfect day revelling in the joys of
  anticipation, crooning over that butter, cuddling it, hiding it in one
  pocket after the other. Towards dusk down came the snow again, and under
  cover thereof the Bosch counter-attacked.</p>

  <p>Patrick says he suddenly heard the bull voice of a Hun officer
  hic-coughing gutturals, and they were on him. He had no time to send up
  an S.O.S. rocket, and his machine-gun jammed. In a minute they were all
  mixed up, at it tooth and claw as merry as a Galway election, the big
  Bosch officer, throwing off a hymn of hate, the life and soul of the
  party. He came for Patrick with an automatic, and Patrick thought all was
  up; and so it would have been but for Goldilocks, who materialized
  suddenly out of nowhere, deftly tripped up his officer from behind, and,
  dancing on his stomach with inspired hooves, trod him out of sight.</p>

  <p>Their moving spirit being wiped out, the Huns lost whatever heart they
  had had, and went through their "Kamerad" exercise without further
  ado.</p>

  <p>When the excitement was over Patrick sought out Goldilocks, and,
  shaking him warmly by the hand, thanked him for suppressing the officer
  and saving the situation.</p>

  <p>"Situation be damned" (or words to that effect), Goldilocks retorted.
  "He would have pinched my butter!"</p>

<h3>THE FLOWERLESS FUTURE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Notes from a Society newspaper of the coming
vegetable epoch.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">PERSONAL PARS.</p>

  <p>We regret to learn that Lady Diana Dashweed has returned from Nice
  suffering from nervous shock. During a battle of vegetables at the recent
  carnival Lady Diana, while in the act of aiming a tomato at a well-known
  peer, was struck on the head by a fourteen-pound marrow hurled by some
  unknown admirer. There is unfortunately a growing tendency at these
  festivities to use missiles over the regulation weight.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A daring innovation was made by last Wednesday's bride. One has become
  so accustomed to the orthodox cauliflower bouquet at weddings that it
  came almost as a shock to see her holding a huge bunch of rich crimson
  beetroots, tied with old-gold streamers. The effect however was
  altogether delightful.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The decorations for a particularly smart "pink-and-white" dinner at
  one of our smartest restaurants last evening were charmingly carried out
  in spring rhubarb and Spanish onions, the table being softly illuminated
  by tinted electric lights concealed in hollow turnips, fashioned to
  represent the heads of famous statesmen.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="center">FROM THE SERIAL STORY.</p>

  <p>"Sick at heart, Adela tottered across the room and, opening her
  bureau, drew from its secret hiding-place an old letter. As she
  tremblingly removed it from the envelope a few faded leaves fluttered
  down to the floor. It was the brussels-sprout he had given her on the
  night they parted."</p>

<h3>CHILDREN'S TALES FOR GROWN-UPS.</h3>

<p class="center">v.</p>

<p class="center">THE RIVALS.</p>

  <p>The frog challenged the nightingale to a singing contest. "Of course
  for gurgling and untutored warbling I know he has it," he said to his
  friend the toad, "but in technique I shall beat him hollow."</p>

  <p>So the jury was chosen. The nightingale proposed the lark, the thrush,
  the blackbird and the bullfinch as experts in singing, and the frog
  proposed the starling, the linnet, the chaffinch and the
  reed-warbler.</p>

  <p>The nightingale was overcome with emotion at the generosity of the
  frog, and insisted on adding the crow and the toad as experts in
  croaking.</p>

  <p>The nightingale sang first, whilst his trade rivals sat and chattered.
  They chattered so loud that the nightingale stopped singing in a
  huff.</p>

  <p>"You are hardly at your best, you know, old thing," said the linnet
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"You will find these throat lozenges excellent for hoarseness," said
  the blackbird.</p>

  <p>"His upper register is weak&mdash;abominably weak," said the starling
  to the lark.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if his voice were trained," suggested the lark.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the frog croaked away lustily, but no one listened to him.
  "The jury must vote by ballot," he said as he finished the last
  croak.</p>

  <p>"Of course we must," twittered the jury.</p>

  <p>The frog won by eight votes to two.</p>

  <p>"I voted for the nightingale," whispered the crow to the toad.</p>

  <p>"So did I," whispered the toad.</p>

<h3>A LOSS.</h3>

  <p>For many reasons the passing of the poster is to be welcomed. For one
  thing, it robbed the papers themselves of that element of surprise which
  is one of life's few spices; for another, it added to life's many
  complexities by forcing the reader into a hunt through the columns which
  often ended in disappointment: in other words the poster's promise was
  not seldom greater than the paper's performance. Then, again, it was
  often offensive, as when it called for the impeachment of an effete "old
  gang," many of whose members had joined the perfect new; or redundant, as
  when it demanded twenty ropes where one would have sufficed.</p>

  <p>But, even although the streets may be said to have been sweetened by
  the absence of posters, days will come, it must be remembered, when we
  shall badly miss them. It goes painfully to one's heart to think that the
  embargo, if it is ever lifted, will not be lifted in time for most of the
  events which we all most desire, events that clamour to be recorded in
  the large black type that for so many years Londoners have associated
  with fatefulness. Such as ("reading from left to right"):&mdash;</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Monday, March 26th.</i>&mdash;Major PRETYMAN NEWMAN has a bright
  sense of humour much appreciated by his fellow-countrymen from Ireland.
  His latest notion is that journals "of a comic and serio-comic nature"
  should be deprived of their stocks of paper in order that catalogues and
  circulars should continue to appear. Mr. GEORGE ROBERTS expressed his
  regret at being unable to discriminate between different classes of
  publications; but I understand that several Members have offered to
  satisfy Major NEWMAN's taste for light literature by lending him their
  old Stores catalogues.</p>

  <p>Housewives who have been economising in their meagre supply of sugar
  in order to have a stock for jam-making have been alarmed by a rumour
  that they would be charged with food-hoarding and made to disgorge their
  savings. There is not a word of truth in it, and they may rest assured,
  on Capt. BATHURST'S authority, that our non-party Government entirely
  approves this form of Conservatism.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/226a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/226a.png"
      alt="MR. BRACE." /></a>
    MR. BRACE.
  </div>
  <p>Misled by Mr. BRACE's appearance&mdash;I have before now noted his
  likeness to an amiable cat&mdash;Mr. SNOWDEN pressed his advocacy of a
  certain conscientious objector called PETT to such lengths as to discover
  that even this kind of cat has claws. "These conscientious objectors,"
  said Mr. BRACE at last, "are not the angels he thinks they are, and it is
  only with the utmost difficulty that a large number of them will do
  anything like reasonable work." Thus a PETT illusion has been shattered.
  Mr. SNOWDEN, however, has plenty more.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, March 27th.</i>&mdash;If British artisans, as at
  Barrow-in-Furness, prefer to strike for Germany, it seems hardly
  reasonable to expect German prisoners to work for England. The nature of
  the "disciplinary measures" which caused the Germans promptly to return
  to work on normal conditions was not disclosed, but it seems a pity that
  they are not tried in the other case.</p>

  <p>"We are getting on," as Sir HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN said on a famous
  occasion. Formerly it was considered the height of Parliamentary
  impropriety to say in so many words that an Hon. Member was not telling
  the truth; and all sorts of more or less transparent subterfuges, of
  which Mr. CHURCHILL's "terminological inexactitude" is the best
  remembered, were employed to evade this breach of good manners. But the
  present House is thicker-skinned than its predecessors, and heard without
  a tremor the following conversation between the MINISTER OF PENSIONS and
  Mr. HOGGE:&mdash;<i>Mr. Barnes:</i> "I never said there was a scale."
  <i>Mr. Hogge:</i> "Yes, you did." <i>Mr. Barnes:</i> "No, I didn't."</p>

  <p>A little later on, Mr. SWIFT MACNEILL always a stickler for
  constitutional precedent, attacked the Government for introducing
  important Bills&mdash;including one for extending once more the life of
  this immortal Parliament&mdash;without vouchsafing any explanation of
  them. He appealed to the SPEAKER to condemn this procedure as being
  contrary to the spirit of the standing order. Mr. LOWTHER explained that
  it was his business to carry out the rules of the House, not to express
  opinions about the use that was made of them. But he ventured to remind
  the Hon. Member that under this rule a Home Rule Bill, a Welsh
  Disestablishment Bill and a Plural Voting Bill had all been introduced on
  a single day. And it is not on record that on that occasion Mr. MACNEILL
  entered any protest.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, March 28th</i>&mdash;Rumours that Mr. ASQUITH was about
  to make a public recantation of his hostility to Women's Suffrage caused
  a large attendance of Members, Peers and the general public. The interval
  of waiting was beguiled by, among others, Mr. PEMBERTON BILLING, who,
  having been told by Mr. MACPHERSON that the number of accidents during
  the training of pilots during the last half-year of 1916 was 1.53 per
  cent., proceeded to inquire, "What is the percentage based on? Is it
  percentage per hundred?" Mr. BILLING may be comforted by the recollection
  that a greater than he, Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, confessed that he "never
  could understand what those d&mdash;d dots meant."</p>

  <p>The Editor of <i>The Glasgow High School Magazine</i> must be a proud
  man this day, for he has been mentioned in Parliament. It seems that he
  has been refused permission to post his periodical to subscribers in
  neutral countries, and Mr. MACPHERSON explained that this was in
  pursuance of a general rule, since "school magazines contain much
  information useful to the enemy." It is pleasant to picture the German
  General Staff laboriously ploughing through reports of football-matches,
  juvenile poems and letters to the Editor complaining of the rise in
  prices at the tuck-shop, in order to discover that Second-Lieutenant
  Blank, of the Umptieth Battery, R.F.A., is stationed in Mesopotamia, and
  therefrom to deduce the present distribution of the British Army.</p>

  <p>The SPEAKER occupied the Chair during the discussion of the
  recommendations of his Conference on Electoral Reform, and heard nothing
  but good of himself. It was, indeed, a notable achievement to have
  induced so heterogeneous a collection of Members to present a practically
  unanimous report on a bundle of problems acutely controversial.</p>

  <p>Only on one point did the Conference fail to agree, and that was in
  regard to Women's Suffrage. But, after Mr. ASQUITH'S handsome admission
  that, by their splendid services in the War, women had worked out their
  own electoral salvation, even that topic seemed to have lost most of its
  provocative quality; and there is a general desire to forget what the
  late PRIME MINISTER described as a detestable campaign and bury the
  hatchet and all the other weapons employed in it.</p>

  <p>Do you recall the distraught lady in <i>Ruddigore</i>, who was always
  charmed into silence by the mystic word "Basingstoke"? More than once
  during Mr. CLAVELL SALTER'S over-elaborated speech I hoped that he <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span> would
  remember his constituency and take the hint. But he went on and on,
  occasionally dropping into a vein of sentiment and working it so hard
  that I quite expected to hear him say, "Gentlemen of the Jury" instead of
  "Mr. Speaker." When it came to the division, however, he only carried
  some three-score stalwarts into the Lobby, and the House decided by a
  majority of 279 to support the Government's intention to give immediate
  effect to the recommendations of the Conference.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, March 29th.</i>&mdash;Employers in want of agricultural
  labourers should apply to Lord NEWTON, who has a large selection of
  interned Austrians, Hungarians and Turks, and undertakes to supply an
  alien "almost by return of post." The Turk is specially recommended, as,
  even if he fails to give complete satisfaction, the farmer can relieve
  the monotony of an arduous existence by "sitting on the Ottoman."</p>

  <p>Brave man as he is, the FOOD CONTROLLER is not prepared to prohibit
  entirely the manufacture of cakes and confectionery. But he is preparing
  to do something hardly less daring, namely, to standardize the types that
  may be sold.</p>

  <p>An old spelling-book used to tell us that "It is agreeable to watch
  the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar when gauging the
  symmetry of a peeled pear." Lord DEVONPORT, occupied in deciding on the
  exact architecture and decoration of the Bath bun (official sealed
  pattern), would make a companion picture.</p>

  <p>The unwillingness of some young Scottish Members to volunteer for
  National Service is now explained. It seems that by an unpardonable
  oversight the appeals of the DIRECTOR-GENERAL, as published in the
  Scottish newspapers, were addressed "to the men of England." The wording
  has now been altered&mdash;not too late, I trust, for the country to
  obtain the valuable assistance of Messrs. PRINGLE and HOGGE.</p>

<h2>CO-OPERATIVE ADVERTISEMENTS.</h2>

  <p>In view of the restriction of the paper supply it has been suggested
  that advertisers should unite in cultivating the available space on a
  co-operative intensive system.</p>

  <p>For example, the various proprietors of three popular brands of
  cigarettes, instead of having a page advertisement each, might combine in
  one single page, like this:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="center">THREE OF THE BEST.</p>

  <p class="center"><i>You cannot consider yourself a connoisseur of<br />
  cigarettes unless you are able to distinguish at<br />
  one and the same time the individually exquisite<br />
  flavours of</i><br />
  "THE BRASS HAT"<br />
  "THE OFFENSIVE."<br />
  "THE GAS ATTACK."</p>

  <p class="center"><i>THERE IS NO OTHER PERFECT BLEND.</i></p>

  <p class="center">These cigarettes are smoked in our patent<br />
  "Trident" cigarette-holders.</p>

  <p class="center">Of all Tobacconists.</p>

  <p>You see? Not only does each manufacturer still obtain the same sale
  for his cigarettes, but he actually gains a third share in the profits of
  a new accessory&mdash;the triple cigarette-holder.</p>

  <p>Of course ingenuity of this sort is not required when the advertisers
  are not in any sense rivals. All that is then necessary is what we may
  call the <i>economic common factor of appeal</i>. For
  instance:&mdash;</p>

  co-operative advertising. We append two samples of what may be done in
  this direction.</p>

<h3>EARLIER FOOD PROBLEMS.</h3>

  <p>Peace, I remember, had her alimentary perplexities not much less
  renowned than war. At any rate I can think of two.</p>

  <p>The first was some years ago, in Yorkshire, on one of those sultry and
  stifling days of August which in winter, or even in such a March as we
  have been suffering, one can view as something more desirable than
  rubies, but which in actual fact are depressing, enervating, and the
  mother of moodiness and fatigue. We had left Chop Yat early in the
  morning after a night of excessive heat in beds of excessive featheriness
  and were walking towards Helmsley by way of Rievaulx, all unconcerned as
  to lunch by the way, because the ordnance map marked with such cordial
  legibility an inn on the road at a reasonable distance. Moreover, was not
  Yorkshire made up of hospitable ridings, and had we not, on the previous
  day, found lunch in this cottage and tea in that, with no trouble at all,
  to say nothing of the terrific spread confronting us at Chop Yat? Why
  then carry anything?</p>

  <p>But we soon began to regret the absence of sustenance, for this kind
  of weather makes for extreme lassitude shot through with rattiness, and
  under its influence nourishment dies in one with painful celerity.</p>

  <p>The blessed word "inn" was however on the ordnance map, and since it
  was the one-inch scale that cannot lie we braced ourselves, mended and
  remended our tempers, and plodded on. The dales no doubt are gorgeous
  places, but under this grey humid sky anyone who wanted it could have had
  my share of Billsdale (as I believe it was). Scenery had become an
  outrage. There was no joy, no beauty; nothing was worth living for but
  that inn. As we laboured forward we cheered each other by word-pictures
  of its parlour, its larder and its cellar. A pork-pie ("porch-peen" I
  fancy the Yorkshiremen call it) would probably be there. Eggs, of course.
  A ham, surely. Bacon, no doubt. Yellow butter, crusty new bread, and
  beer. Indeed, let the rest go, so long as there was beer. But beer, of
  course, was beyond any question; an inn without beer was unthinkable.</p>

  <p>Thus the miles wore away until, footsore, sticky and faint, we came
  upon the hostelry itself&mdash;only to find, instead of any grateful sign
  and the promise of delight, the frigid words, "Friends' Meeting House,"
  painted on the board....</p>

  <p>That was one experience, over which a veil may well be drawn. The
  other was not so long ago, in Sussex, a little before the War. This time
  we had not walked, but had done that much more hungrifying thing&mdash;we
  had been for hours in a motor-car, exceedingly engaged on the task of
  looking at houses to let. At last, utterly worn out, in the way that
  motoring can wear out body, soul and nerves, and filled with a ravening
  desire to tear meat limb from limb, we came to an inn of which our host
  had the highest opinion&mdash;so high, indeed, that, empty though we
  were, he had forced the car at full-speed past at least half-a-dozen
  admirable but less pretentious houses, where I, in my small way, had more
  than once been nourished and sustained.</p>

  <p>When, however, at last we did arrive at his desired haven, late in the
  afternoon, when dusk was beginning to fall and blur with her gentle hand
  the sharp lines of hill and tree, we acknowledged his wisdom, for in the
  window beside the door, where we creakingly but joyfully alighted, were
  visible, although no longer distinctly, a vast ham as yet uncut and two
  richly-browned cold fowls. "There," said he, with a pardonable triumph,
  "didn't I tell you?" and so, our lips trembling with the anticipation of
  nutriment, we entered, flung off our wraps, and prepared, on the
  evidence, for such bliss as earth too rarely affords. But alas for hopes
  raised only to be shattered, for the host had nothing to offer us but
  bread and cheese. The ham and chickens were of <i>papier-mâché</i>.</p>

<h2>FROM LORD DEVONPORT'S LETTER-BAG.</h2>

<p class="center">I.&mdash;<i>From Professor Tripewell.</i></p>

  <p>MY LORD,&mdash;You will, no doubt, forgive me for drawing your
  attention to the fact that the rationing system, to which you have lent
  the credit of your name, will bring us to the end of our food supplies in
  something considerably less than a month from now. I am far from wishing
  to be an alarmist, but it is as well that we should face the facts,
  especially when they are supported by statistics so irrefutable as those
  which I am willing to produce to you at any moment on receiving your
  request to do so.</p>

  <p>Fortunately it is not yet too late to apply a simple and adequate
  remedy to this condition of affairs. All you have to do is to issue
  <i>and enforce</i> an Order in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) Every occasion on which food, no matter how small the amount, is
  eaten shall count as a meal.</p>

  <p>(2) Not more than two meals shall be eaten by any person, of whatever
  size, age or sex, in a day of twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>(3) No meal shall last more than ten minutes.</p>

  <p>(4) The mastication of every mouthful shall last not less than thirty
  seconds.</p>

  <p>(5) A mouthful for the purpose of this Order shall not consist of more
  food than can be conveyed to the mouth in an ordinary teaspoon.</p>

  <p>I venture to think that this order, <i>if issued at once and
  drastically applied</i>, will meet every difficulty, and that we shall
  hear no more of a shortage.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">II.&mdash;<i>From Joshua Stodmarsh.</i></p>

  <p>DEAR OLD SPORT,&mdash;It won't do&mdash;really it won't. I've been
  doing my best to give your plan of food rations a fair run, and every
  week I've found myself on the wrong side of the fence. I have never
  considered myself a large or reckless eater, though I own to having had a
  liking for a good breakfast (fish, kidneys and eggs, with muffin or
  buttered toast and marmalade) as a start for the day. Then came
  luncheon&mdash;steak or chop or Irish stew, with a roly-poly pudding to
  follow, and a top-up of bread-and-butter and cheese. Tea, of course, at
  five o'clock, with more buttered toast, and then home to a good solid
  dinner of soup, fish and <i>entrée</i> and joint and some sort of sweet.
  This just left room for an occasional supper&mdash;say three times a
  week. It doesn't sound out of the way, now does it? And you must remember
  that I'm not one of your thin, dwarfish, anæmic blokes that you could
  feed out of a packet of bird-seed. No, I stand six foot, and I don't
  weigh an ounce under seventeen stone. Dear old boy, you can't have the
  heart to ask me to do it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">III.&mdash;From <i>Miss Lavinia Fluttermere</i>.</p>

  <p>DEAR LORD DEVONPORT,&mdash;I am writing on behalf of my sister
  Penelope as well as on my own to bring before you a difficulty under
  which we are labouring in connection with your Lordship's order in regard
  to the consumption of food. We are two sisters, the daughters of a
  country clergyman, who died when I was eighteen and Penelope a year and a
  half younger. I tell you this to show you that we were not accustomed in
  our youth to luxurious living. For many years now Penelope and I have
  lived together in a very small way on the income of an annuity for our
  joint lives which was bought with a sum of money left to us by an uncle.
  On this we have managed to get along comfortably, and have even been able
  to pay for occasional help in the work of our very modest household. When
  your Lordship's food order was issued we determined to obey it strictly,
  being glad of an opportunity to show our patriotic devotion to the cause
  of our country. "It will be hard for us, Penelope," I said, "for we are
  not used to such quantities of meat, and even the allowance of bread is
  too great, I fear, for our poor appetites; but, since Lord DEVONPORT
  wishes it, all we can do is to obey, even though this may entail a change
  in our manner of living and an increase in our weekly expenses." Penelope
  agreed, and on this principle we have endeavoured to act. We have,
  however, now found the task to be beyond our capacity, though we have
  struggled loyally to fulfil the duty imposed upon us; and we write to ask
  your Lordship to grant us some dispensation, lest permanent plethora
  should ensue.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>MR. CONRAD'S new hero is an unnamed chief-mate who gets his first
  command to a sailing vessel, also unnamed&mdash;queer and of course quite
  deliberate instance of the author's reticent, allusive method which is so
  entirely plausible. Her last captain, who had some mad savage hatred of
  ship and crew, died aboard her and was buried in latitude 8° 20'. The
  chief-mate, who got the vessel back to port and remained under her new
  captain, is convinced that the dead man haunts her vengefully; and one
  desperate accident after another, racking a crew overwhelmed with fever,
  almost persuades the captain to share the mate's illusion that 8°
  20'&mdash;<i>The Shadow Line</i> (DENT)&mdash;is possessed by the dead
  scoundrel. I found the book less interesting as a yarn than as an example
  of the astonishingly conscious and perfect artistry of this really great
  master of the ways of men and words. Mr. CONRAD never made me believe
  that the new captain would go so near sharing his mate's superstitious
  panic (which is perhaps because I know little of sailor-men save what he
  has taught me); and in the incident, so curiously and deliberately
  detailed, of his finding the quinine bottles filled with a worthless
  substitute, and letting them "each in turn" slip to ground, I had again
  the most unusual shock of being unable to accept the credibility of his
  invention. This is so rare an experience that it only throws into relief
  for me the fine craft of this most brilliant of our impressionists, who
  tells so much with such delicate strokes, so conscientiously considered,
  so unerringly conveyed.</p>

  <p><i>This is the End</i> (MACMILLAN) is the kind of book that only youth
  can write&mdash;youth at its best. It has the qualities and defects of
  its parentage; but the qualities, a fine careless rapture, sensitive
  vision, a wayward and jolly fantasy, challenging provocativeness, faintly
  malicious humour, are dominant. Miss STELLA BENSON will grow out of her
  youthful cynicisms and intolerances, will focus her effects, without
  losing any of her substantial equipment. This is by no means the end. It
  is the second step of a very brilliant beginning. Already it shows
  improvement upon her first clever book, <i>I Pose</i>; a surer touch, a
  finer restraint. What is it all about? Does that matter? It is the manner
  of the telling rather than what is told that constitutes the charm. If I
  tell, you that <i>Jay</i> runs away from a respectable home, and, after a
  grievous experiment as a bolster-filler, becomes a bus-conductor, has a
  romantic friendship with a middle-aged married man, and marries the
  faithful <i>Mr. Morgan</i>, her dead brother's soldier friend, I have
  told you just nothing at all. I will merely add that you will be foolish
  if you miss this book.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I have to begin by confessing that, despite its most attractive title,
  my first glance into <i>French Windows</i> (ARNOLD) produced in me some
  feeling of prejudice. It was not that I failed to recognise both dignity
  and beauty of phrase in the writing; on the contrary, I told myself that
  "Mr. JOHN AYSCOUGH" had been betrayed by his own appreciation of
  beautiful phrases into an indulgence in "style," a deliberate arrangement
  of his war-pictures that was somehow out of harmony with the stark and
  horrible simplicity of their subject. But I hasten to make confession
  that this was but <span class="pagenum"><a name="page232"
  id="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span> a passing and, I am convinced, a wrong
  judgment. Indeed, the abiding impression that the book has left upon me
  is one of enormous sincerity. Both as a soldier and a priest, the writer
  enjoyed (as his publishers quite justly say) special opportunities for
  getting into touch with men of all sorts and conditions. This, aided by
  his own gift of sympathy and comradeship, has resulted in a book that is
  very largely a record of fleeting but genuine friendships, made with
  individual soldiers, both French and English, in the Western battle. Many
  of them contain portraits and character-studies (a pedantic term for
  anything so sensitive and sympathetic as these tributes to nameless
  heroes, but I can find no better) that linger in the memory. I defy you,
  for example, to forget soon the story of that winter walk taken by the
  writer and certain officer-boys of his unit to the Cistercian Monastery,
  and what <i>Chutney</i> said by the way; and what happened afterwards.
  For the sake of such sincere and memorable sketches as this I am more
  than ready to forgive what seemed like a touch of artifice elsewhere.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. GEORGE MOORE, continuing his labours as reviser and
  editor-in-chief of the Moorish masterpieces, has now directed his
  attention to <i>A Modern Lover</i>. Finding this (presumably) not modern
  enough, he has refashioned and republished it under the admirably
  comprehensive title of <i>Lewis Seymour and Some Women</i> (HEINEMANN).
  Not having the original at hand, I am unable to indulge in comparisons;
  but there seems good reason to suppose that <i>Lewis Seymour's</i>
  relations with the three amiable ladies who assist his artistic and
  amatory career remain very much what they probably were in the beginning.
  As for the tale itself, that too will hardly belie your expectation,
  being full of cleverness, carried off with an infectious gaiety, and
  boasting (I use the word advisedly) more than a sufficiency of that
  rather assertive and school-boy impropriety which the charitable might
  quote as evidence of our author's perpetual youth. It is an interesting,
  though perhaps futile, speculation to reflect how Mr. THOMAS HARDY, to
  whose plots the present bears some resemblance, might have handled it.
  Had <i>Lewis Seymour</i> pursued his education in womanhood under the
  guidance of the wizard of Dorchester there would probably have been less
  of the atmosphere of holiday humour; but, on the other hand, we should
  almost certainly have been spared the quite superfluous naughtiness of
  the Parisian scenes. By the way, talking of Paris, surely I am right in
  supposing that the vision of a revived Versailles was an experience of
  two ladies? It is unexpected to find Mr. MOORE denying anything to "the
  sex."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Of the late Mr. JACK LONDON'S alternative methods of writing, the
  defiantly propagandist and the joyously adventurous, I, being an average
  reader, have always preferred the latter; so that, remembering how
  separate and distinct he usually kept his two styles, I expected, in
  taking up <i>The Strength of the Strong</i> (MILLS AND BOON), to be
  immediately either disappointed or gratified. But, as it turns out, the
  half-dozen essay-stories that make up this slender volume are by no means
  characteristic, for there is very little plot in any, and even less
  attempt forcibly to extract a moral; and amongst them are two not very
  successful North of Ireland studies that seem to have no connection at
  all with the author's usual manner. The volume is made up of social
  pictures, all (as Mr. LONDON liked to pretend) within his own experience,
  presented impartially for you to study, and draw, if you choose, your own
  conclusions. That experience ranges, comprehensively enough, from a
  first-hand sketch of primeval man attempting rather unhappily to group
  himself in clans and tribes, to a journalistic note of the Yellow Peril
  that materialised, we learn, somewhere late in the twentieth century and
  was overcome by science liberating disease&mdash;a Hunnish method no
  longer novel. Of the series I like best the tale of the San Francisco
  professor of dual personality, who by dint of much practical study of
  labour problems came at last to cut loose from his own circle and
  disappear in the army of industry. In this chapter alone is there a spark
  of the volcanic fire, now unhappily no longer in eruption, that blazes in
  such great stories as <i>The Sea Wolf</i>, <i>Adventure</i> and
  <i>Burning Daylight</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Though there may be no very particular reason why you should be
  invited to read <i>The Love Story of Guillaume-Marc</i> (HUTCHINSON) it
  is, I vouch, a vivid enough tale of its <i>genre</i>. Squeamish folk,
  perhaps, may think that this is not the most opportune time at which to
  draw attention to the blood-lust that was so marked a feature of the
  French Revolution. But, granted that you do not suffer from squeams, you
  will find Miss MARIAN BOWER a deft weaver of romance. Here love and
  adventure walk firmly hand-in-hand, and from the moment
  <i>Guillaume-Marc</i> makes his entrance upon the stage until the happy
  ending is reached any day might have been his last. The villain, too, is
  a satisfactory scoundrel, and cunning withal. "Brains," he considered,
  "may conceive revolutions, but it is the empty stomach which propagates
  them." I wonder whether they have the brains for it in Berlin.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
